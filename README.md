# how_to_run_vitess_locally
setup vitess locally with Oracle Linux 7.6 with MySQL 5.7 
recently, I setup vitess with Oracle Linux 7.6 and MySQL 5.7 from scratch "successfully". I say "successfully" because I reach to step: ./303_horizontal_split.sh without any error message. and I think it is impossible to setup / execute shell file according to the official doc :  https://vitess.io/docs/get-started/local/ . also I think vitess dev team must have professional DBA working with them. 

there are two main parts of this doc: 
a. how to setup Oracle Linux 
b. how to setup MySQL
